# Arrange Artboard plugin for Sketch

This is a fork of Ken Moor's Arrange Artboard plugin. It's simplified version of the plugin where there is no prompt to set up row count. Plugin arranges all artboards in one row by default. Also, artboard sorting order was reversed to match layer list order from top to bottom.

Managing artboards can get messy, especially when you insert artboards in the middle of a sequence.
The Arrange Artboard plugin lays out all your artboards in one row.


Works great in conjuction with these plugins:
 - [Numberize](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-commands/tree/master/Numberize)
 - [Next /Previous Artboard](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-plugins-1)
